## 65-YEARS OLD
I can provide general guidance on how to live a healthier and better life, but please keep in mind that every individual's situation is unique, and it is essential to consult with a medical professional before making any significant changes to one's lifestyle or health-related decisions.

Here are some general tips that may help Sunita Sharma live a healthier and better life:

Maintain a healthy diet: A healthy diet is crucial to maintaining good health, especially as we age. Encourage Sunita Sharma to consume a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats.

Stay active: Regular physical activity can help Sunita Sharma maintain muscle mass, strength, and flexibility, which is essential for healthy aging. Encourage her to engage in physical activity that she enjoys, such as walking, yoga, or swimming.

Get enough rest: Adequate rest is essential for good health, especially as we age. Encourage Sunita Sharma to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night and establish a consistent sleep schedule.

Manage stress: Chronic stress can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Encourage Sunita Sharma to engage in stress-reducing activities such as meditation, deep breathing, or spending time with loved ones.

Stay socially active: Maintaining social connections can help prevent loneliness and isolation, which can have negative health consequences. Encourage Sunita Sharma to stay socially active by participating in community activities or spending time with friends and family.

Regular health check-ups: Encourage Sunita Sharma to schedule regular health check-ups with her doctor to monitor her health and detect any potential health issues early on.

Take medications as prescribed: If Sunita Sharma is taking medications, it is crucial to take them as prescribed by her doctor to manage any health conditions properly.

Remember that small changes can make a big difference in improving health and well-being. Encourage Sunita Sharma to make gradual changes that she can maintain over time, and seek the advice of a medical professional before making any significant lifestyle changes.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
